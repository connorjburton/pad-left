# Pad Left
In light of [this](https://medium.com/@azerbike/i-ve-just-liberated-my-modules-9045c06be67c) and [and this](http://www.haneycodes.net/npm-left-pad-have-we-forgotten-how-to-program/) I thought it'd be interesting to see just how simple `left-pad` is. Very, it turns out.

Disclamer: This isn't supposed to be a replacement or alternative to `left-pad` - just wanted to see for myself how crazy it is to require a dependency for something so simple.
